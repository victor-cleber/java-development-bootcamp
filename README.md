# 🎓  What is OOP?

Object Oriented Programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

- **OOP** is faster and easier to execute
- **OOP** provides a clear structure for the programs
- **OOP** helps to keep code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- **OOP** makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

## Four Principles of OOP

- **Inheritance** child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class
- **Encapsulation** containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
- **Abstraction** only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object
- **Polymorphism** many methods can do the same task
