## Code 

> Create a folder structure 
```
src/com/dio/base/
```

> Create an Order class
```
# vim src/com/dio/base/Order.java

package com.dio.base;

import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class Order {
                
        private final String code;
        private final BigDecimal totalValue;

        public Order (String code, BigDecimal totalValue){
                this.code = code;
                this.totalValue = totalValue;
        }
        
        @Override
        public String toString() {
                return "Order=[" +
                        "code='" + code + "'" +
                        "fees=$'" + calculateFee() + "'" +
                        "]";
        }

        public BigDecimal calculateFee(){
                if (this.totalValue > 100){
                        return this.totalValue.multiply(new BigDecimal("0.99"));
                }else{
                        return this.totalValue;
                }                
        }
}
```

> Create a Main program

```
# vim src/com/dio/MyFirstProgram.java

package com.dio;

import com.dio.base.Order;

public class MyFirstProgram{
        public static void main(String[] args){
                final Order order = new Order("code1234", 540);
                System.out.println(order);
        }
}
```

## Execute
```
javac -d myFirstProgram/ -sourcepath src/ src/com/dio/MyFirstProgram.java

cd myFirstProgram

java com.dio.MyFirstProgram
```

# ðŸŽ“  What is OOP?

Object Oriented Programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

- **OOP** is faster and easier to execute
- **OOP** provides a clear structure for the programs
- **OOP** helps to keep code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- **OOP** makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

## Four Principles of OOP

- **Inheritance** child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class.
- **Encapsulation** containing information in an object, exposing only selected information.
- **Abstraction** only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object.
- **Polymorphism** many methods can do the same task.

## Blocks of OOP
- Classes
- Objects
- Methods
- Attributes

## Java Key Words
abstract<br>        continue        float           native          strictfp        void
assert          default         for             new             super           volatile

class           final           interface       short           true
const           finally         long            static          try

## Acesss modifiers
Java has two types of modifiers: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.

Whith the access modifiers we can specify the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. We have a power to change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and class by applying the access modifier on it.

They are four types of Java access modifiers:
- **Private**: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
- **Default**: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
- **Protected**: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
- **Public**: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.

> There are many non-access modifiers, such as static, abstract, synchronized, native, volatile, transient, etc. (https://www.javatpoint.com/access-modifiers)

## Methods
- **Constructors** define how a class will be buit.
- **Common** are methods defined by the business rules.

## Java Conditions and If Statements
Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
- Equal to a == b
- Not Equal to: a != b

**if else** 
```
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
  System.out.println("Good morning.");
} else if (time < 20) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
// Outputs "Good evening."
```
**switch case**
```
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```
